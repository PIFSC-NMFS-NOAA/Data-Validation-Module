# Data Validation Module
## Overview:
The Data Validation Module (DVM) was developed to provide a framework to validate data entered in the database based on flexible data validation criteria that can be developed and implemented in Oracle Views by a data manager/developer without requiring application development skills.  A series of QC Views can be developed to identify problematic values in the database and implemented in the framework to allow each criteria to be evaluated on the given data stream.
