deprecated flag in the error_types table to indicate that even if an error was active at a certain time it will no longer be evaluated (for invalid/deprecated validation criteria)

implement transactions

X - change DVM_ERRORS.ERROR_DESCRIPTION and DVM_ERROR_TYPES.ERR_TYPE_COMMENT_TEMPLATE to a CLOB data type:

need to handle replacing existing errors so that the error records are not purged each time the module is executed:
    - match up on generated ERROR_DESCRIPTION and error_type_ID and remove/disable the existing errors that don't match up 




cases for script:

X - Give parent record does not exist

X - No DVM_PTA_ERRORS record for the given parent record

X - A DVM_PTA_ERRORS record exists for the give parent record

A DVM_PTA_ERRORS record and error records exist for the give parent record



application tables: QC query to determine if there are error templates with placeholders that are not included in the result set of the corresponding QC query

X - update the LAST_EVAL_DATE on the PTA_ERRORS record


X - how do we query for the validation criteria using DBMS_SQL so that we can use multiple data stream codes?
