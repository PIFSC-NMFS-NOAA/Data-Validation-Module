# Data Validation Module Business Rule Documentation
## Overview:  
There are multiple aspects of the Data Validation Module (DVM) and each has its own set of business rules.  In addition there are some business rules that apply to the underlying database and therefore all associated aspects of the module.  The [Business Rule List](./DVM%20-%20Business%20Rules.xlsx) shows each of the specific business rules that apply to the given defined scope.   

## Scope Descriptions:
 - DVM DB - these business rules apply to the underlying database used by all aspects of the module
 - DVM Configuration QC - these business rules are the specific DVM configuration quality control (QC) views that are used to ensure that the DVM configuration is valid before it is used for processing.
 - DVM Processing Errors - these business rules apply to error conditions while executing the DVM
